📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained using past stock prices and forecasts the next day's closing price.

🚀 Features

✅ Fetches real-time historical stock data using yfinance

✅ Preprocesses data using MinMaxScaler for normalization

✅ Uses LSTM neural networks for time series forecasting

✅ Implements train-validation split for better performance evaluation

✅ Early stopping to prevent overfitting

✅ Visualizes actual vs. predicted stock prices

🔧 Installation

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/vishaljain147/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required libraries:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create a requirements.txt file with the following content):

nginx
yfinance
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
matplotlib

📊 Usage

1️⃣ Run the Script

Modify the stock ticker (e.g., 'AAPL' for Apple) in the ticker variable and execute:

bash

python lstm_stock_prediction.py

2️⃣ Change the Stock Symbol

To predict another stock (e.g., Google), modify this line in lstm_stock_prediction.py:

python

ticker = 'GOOG'  # Google

🧠 Model Architecture
The LSTM Model consists of:

📌 3 LSTM Layers (100 units each, with dropout of 20%)

📌 Dense Layer (50 neurons, ReLU activation)

📌 Output Layer (1 neuron for predicting stock price)

📌 Optimizer: Adam

📌 Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

📈 Results
The model predicts the next day's stock price based on historical data.
A graph is plotted to compare actual vs. predicted prices over time.
Training and validation loss is visualized to monitor model performance.

📝 Example Output

vbnet

Predicted next day's stock price: $178.45

(The value represents the forecasted closing price for the next day.)

📊 Visualizations
